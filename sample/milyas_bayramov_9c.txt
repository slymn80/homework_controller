GradeQuestion:What is the primary gas that scientists identify as the main cause of the enhanced greenhouse effect and subsequent global warming linked to human activities (such as burning fossil fuels)? Explain how this gas impacts the climate and list the main anthropogenic (human-caused) sources of its emissions.Answer:The primary gas that scientists identify as the main cause of the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming linked to human activities is Carbon Dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$).This gas plays a crucial role in the natural greenhouse effect, which is essential for life on Earth. The Earth's atmosphere, containing small amounts of greenhouse gases (including water vapor, methane, and $\text{CO}_2$), acts like a blanket: it allows solar energy to reach the surface but traps some of the heat (infrared radiation) that the Earth emits back into space. This natural process maintains the planet's average temperature at a habitable level ($\approx 15^\circ\text{C}$).The problem arises when human activities increase the concentration of these gases, particularly $\text{CO}_2$, in the atmosphere. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution (roughly the mid-18th century), humans have extensively burned fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production, transportation, and industry. This process releases vast amounts of $\text{CO}_2$ that had been locked away underground for millions of years, thus disrupting the natural balance of the carbon cycle.The increased concentration of $\text{CO}_2$ means that the atmosphere traps more heat, leading to a stronger greenhouse effect and a rise in the average global temperatureâ€”the phenomenon known as global warming. Even a small rise in average temperature has severe consequences, including:Melting Glaciers and Sea-Level Rise: Increased heat accelerates the melting of glaciers and ice sheets in polar regions and mountains. This water flows into the oceans, causing sea levels to rise and posing a significant threat to coastal areas and islands.Extreme Weather Events: The warming of the atmosphere holds more energy, leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, prolonged droughts, and heatwaves.Ecosystem Changes: Many plant and animal species cannot adapt quickly enough to the rapid climate change. This leads to a loss of biodiversity and the destruction of important ecosystems like forests and coral reefs.The main anthropogenic sources of $\text{CO}_2$ emissions are:Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat generation.Transportation: Burning gasoline and diesel in cars, trucks, planes, and ships.Industry: Emissions from manufacturing processes (cement, steel, chemicals) and from burning fuel to run factories.Deforestation: Forests are crucial carbon "sinks" as trees absorb $\text{CO}_2$ through photosynthesis. When forests are cut down and burned, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as $\text{CO}_2$.In conclusion, while $\text{CO}_2$ is a natural component of the atmosphere, the excess emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver behind modern climate change.
